## Total Relighting: Learning to Relight Portraits for Background Replacement [14]<a name="14"></a>
Properly relight any portrait based on the lighting of the new background you add. Have you ever wanted to change the background of a picture but have it look realistic? If you’ve already tried that, you already know that it isn’t simple. You can’t just take a picture of yourself in your home and change the background for a beach. It just looks bad and not realistic. Anyone will just say “that’s photoshopped” in a second. For movies and professional videos, you need the perfect lighting and artists to reproduce a high-quality image, and that’s super expensive. There’s no way you can do that with your own pictures. Or can you?

## Enhancing Photorealism Enhancement [16]<a name="16"></a>
This AI can be applied live to the video game and transform every frame to look much more natural. The researchers from Intel Labs just published this paper called Enhancing Photorealism Enhancement. And if you think that this may be "just another GAN," taking a picture of the video game as an input and changing it following the style of the natural world, let me change your mind. They worked on this model for two years to make it extremely robust. It can be applied live to the video game and transform every frame to look much more natural. Just imagine the possibilities where you can put a lot less effort into the game graphic, make it super stable and complete, then improve the style using this model...

## DefakeHop: A Light-Weight High-Performance Deepfake Detector [17]<a name="17"></a>
How to Spot a Deep Fake in 2021. Breakthrough US Army technology using artificial intelligence to find deepfakes.

While they seem like they’ve always been there, the very first realistic deepfake didn’t appear until 2017. It went from the first-ever resembling fake images automatically generated to today’s identical copy of someone on videos, with sound.

The reality is that we cannot see the difference between a real video or picture and a deepfake anymore. How can we tell what’s real from what isn’t? How can audio files or video files be used in court as proof if an AI can entirely generate them? Well, this new paper may provide answers to these questions. And the answer here may again be the use of artificial intelligence. The saying “I’ll believe it when I’ll see it” may soon change for “I’ll believe it when the AI tells me to believe it…”

## TextStyleBrush: Transfer of text aesthetics from a single example [20]<a name="20"></a>
This new Facebook AI model can translate or edit text directly in the image in your own language, following the same style!

Imagine you are on vacation in another country where you do not speak the language. You want to try out a local restaurant, but their menu is in the language you don’t speak. I think this won’t be too hard to imagine as most of us already faced this situation whether you see menu items or directions and you can’t understand what’s written. Well, in 2020, you would take out your phone and google translate what you see. In 2021 you don’t even need to open google translate anymore and try to write what you see one by one to translate it. Instead, you can simply use this new model by Facebook AI to translate every text in the image in your own language…

## Styleclip: Text-driven manipulation of StyleGAN imagery [28]<a name="28"></a>
AI could generate images, then, using a lot of brainpower and trial and error, researchers could control the results following specific styles. Now, with this new model, you can do that using only text!

## TimeLens: Event-based Video Frame Interpolation [29]<a name="29"></a>
TimeLens can understand the movement of the particles in-between the frames of a video to reconstruct what really happened at a speed even our eyes cannot see. In fact, it achieves results that our intelligent phones and no other models could reach before!

## Diverse Generation from a Single Video Made Possible [30]<a name="30"></a>
Have you ever wanted to edit a video?

Remove or add someone, change the background, make it last a bit longer, or change the resolution to fit a specific aspect ratio without compressing or stretching it. For those of you who already ran advertisement campaigns, you certainly wanted to have variations of your videos for AB testing and see what works best. Well, this new research by Niv Haim et al. can help you do all of these out of a single video and in HD!

Indeed, using a simple video, you can perform any tasks I just mentioned in seconds or a few minutes for high-quality videos. You can basically use it for any video manipulation or video generation application you have in mind. It even outperforms GANs in all ways and doesn’t use any deep learning fancy research nor requires a huge and impractical dataset! And the best thing is that this technique is scalable to high-resolution videos.

## Skillful Precipitation Nowcasting using Deep Generative Models of Radar [31]<a name="31"></a>
DeepMind just released a Generative model able to outperform widely-used nowcasting methods in 89% of situations for its accuracy and usefulness assessed by more than 50 expert meteorologists! Their model focuses on predicting precipitations in the next 2 hours and achieves that surprisingly well. It is a generative model, which means that it will generate the forecasts instead of simply predicting them. It basically takes radar data from the past to create future radar data. So using both time and spatial components from the past, they can generate what it will look like in the near future.

You can see this as the same as Snapchat filters, taking your face and generating a new face with modifications on it. To train such a generative model, you need a bunch of data from both the human faces and the kind of face you want to generate. Then, using a very similar model trained for many hours, you will have a powerful generative model. This kind of model often uses GANs architectures for training purposes and then uses the generator model independently.

## The Cocktail Fork Problem: Three-Stem Audio Separation for Real-World Soundtracks [32]<a name="32"></a>
Have you ever tuned in to a video or a TV show and the actors were completely inaudible, or the music was way too loud? Well, this problem, also called the cocktail party problem, may never happen again. Mitsubishi and Indiana University just published a new model as well as a new dataset tackling this task of identifying the right soundtrack. For example, if we take the same audio clip we just ran with the music way too loud, you can simply turn up or down the audio track you want to give more importance to the speech than the music.

The problem here is isolating any independent sound source from a complex acoustic scene like a movie scene or a youtube video where some sounds are not well balanced. Sometimes you simply cannot hear some actors because of the music playing or explosions or other ambient sounds in the background. Well, if you successfully isolate the different categories in a soundtrack, it means that you can also turn up or down only one of them, like turning down the music a bit to hear all the other actors correctly. This is exactly what the researchers achieved.

## ADOP: Approximate Differentiable One-Pixel Point Rendering [33]<a name="33"></a>
Imagine you want to generate a 3D model or simply a fluid video out of a bunch of pictures you took. Well, it is now possible! I don't want to give out too much, but the results are simply amazing and you need to check it out by yourself!

## (Style)CLIPDraw: Coupling Content and Style in Text-to-Drawing Synthesis [34]<a name="34"></a>
Have you ever dreamed of taking the style of a picture, like this cool TikTok drawing style on the left, and applying it to a new picture of your choice? Well, I did, and it has never been easier to do. In fact, you can even achieve that from only text and can try it right now with this new method and their Google Colab notebook available for everyone (see references). Simply take a picture of the style you want to copy, enter the text you want to generate, and this algorithm will generate a new picture out of it! Just look back at the results above, such a big step forward! The results are extremely impressive, especially if you consider that they were made from a single line of text!
